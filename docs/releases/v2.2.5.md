# Release Notes v2.2.5

**Release Date:** 2025-11-10  
**Type:** UI/UX Improvement

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Header Countdown
- **Live countdown display in header** when application is idle
- Shows time until next run in a compact format:
  - Hours + minutes: `2h 15m`
  - Minutes + seconds: `45m 30s`
  - Seconds only: `45s`
- **Pulse animation** when less than 1 minute remaining
- Only visible when `repeat_mode` is active and countdown is available

### Header Control Button
- **Replaced oversized Control Panel card** with a compact, dynamic button in the header
- Button changes based on application state:
  - **Idle:** "Run Now" button (⏭️) - triggers immediate processing
  - **Running:** "Pause" button (⏸) - pauses current processing
  - **Paused:** "Resume" button (▶) - resumes paused processing
- Clean, minimal design that doesn't clutter the interface
- Button appears next to status indicator in header for easy access

## 🗑️ Removed

### Control Panel Card
- Removed dedicated "Control Panel" card from Overview tab
- All functionality moved to the compact header button
