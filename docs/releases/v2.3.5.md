# Release Notes v2.3.5

**Release Date:** 2025-11-10  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### German Text Translation

**Problem:** WebGUI still had German text in statistics labels, making it inconsistent with the rest of the English interface.

**Solution:** 
- Translated all German text to English:
  - "Verarbeitet" → "Processed"
  - "Fehlgeschlagen" → "Failed"
  - "Nicht unterstützt" → "Not Supported"
  - "Gelöscht" → "Deleted"
- Translated all German comments to English

**Impact:** Consistent English-only interface throughout the application.

### System Health Debugging

**Problem:** System health metrics showing 0.0% or empty values with no way to diagnose why.

**Solution:** 
- Added comprehensive logging for system health updates
- Logs warnings when paths don't exist
- Logs errors when disk usage calculation fails
- Logs debug info for successful updates (visible with `--log-level DEBUG`)

**Impact:** Easier to diagnose system health issues. Logs will show exactly why disk space isn't being calculated.

### Countdown Visible from Start

**Problem:** Countdown for next run was only visible after the first run completed, leaving users wondering when the next run would start.

**Solution:** 
- Set initial `next_run_time` when application starts
- Countdown now shows immediately when repeat mode is enabled
- No need to wait for first run to complete

**Impact:** Better user experience - countdown visible from application start.

### Next Run Time Set After Processing

**Problem:** After processing completed, the next run countdown wasn't always visible.

**Solution:** 
- Re-set `next_run_time` after each processing run completes
- Ensures countdown is always visible between runs when repeat mode is enabled

**Impact:** Countdown updates correctly and is always visible when repeat mode is active.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Logging Added

```python
_logger.debug(f"System Health: Downloads path {downloads_path} - {usage.used / (1024**3):.2f} GB used")
_logger.warning(f"System Health: Downloads path {downloads_path} does not exist")
_logger.error(f"Failed to get disk usage for downloads_path {downloads_path}: {e}")
```

### Countdown Initialization

```python
# Set initial next run time so countdown is visible from start
if settings.repeat_forever and settings.repeat_after_minutes > 0:
    tracker.set_next_run(settings.repeat_after_minutes)
```

### Next Run Time Reset

```python
# Set next run time after processing completes (if repeat mode is enabled)
if args.webgui and settings.repeat_forever and settings.repeat_after_minutes > 0:
    tracker.set_next_run(settings.repeat_after_minutes)
```

## 📋 Migration Guide

### No Migration Required

This release is fully backward compatible. No migration steps are required.

### Debugging System Health Issues

If system health still shows 0.0%, check logs:

1. Enable debug logging: `--log-level DEBUG`
2. Look for log messages containing "System Health:"
3. Check if paths exist and are accessible
4. Verify Docker volume mounts are correct

## 🔍 Expected Log Output

**Success:**
```
[DEBUG] System Health: Downloads path /data/downloads - 123.45 GB used
[DEBUG] System Health: Extracted path /data/extracted - 67.89 GB used
[DEBUG] System Health: Finished path /data/finished - 34.56 GB used
```

**Path Not Found:**
```
[WARNING] System Health: Downloads path /data/downloads does not exist
```

**Permission Error:**
```
[ERROR] Failed to get disk usage for downloads_path /data/downloads: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```

## 🎯 Testing

### Verify Translations

1. Open WebGUI at http://localhost:8080
2. Check Statistics section - all labels should be in English

### Verify Countdown

1. Set `repeat_forever = true` and `repeat_after_minutes = 30` in settings
2. Start application
3. Countdown should be visible immediately in header
4. After processing completes, countdown should reset

### Verify System Health

1. Enable debug logging: `--log-level DEBUG`
2. Check logs for "System Health:" messages
3. Verify disk space values are shown in WebGUI

## 📝 Notes

- All user-facing text is now in English
- System health logging helps diagnose Docker volume mount issues
- Countdown is visible from application start, improving UX
- No breaking changes - fully backward compatible
