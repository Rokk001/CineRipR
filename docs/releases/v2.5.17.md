# Release Notes v2.5.17

**Release Date:** 2025-11-13  
**Type:** Performance Optimization

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

### Reduced Idle CPU Usage

**Problem:**
- Even after removing the system health background thread, idle CPU usage remained at ~8%
- Settings check was running every 5 seconds during sleep phase
- This caused ~12 database queries per minute even when idle
- Minute-based logging checked the condition every second

**Solution:**
- Increased settings check interval from 5 to 30 seconds
- Reduces database queries from ~12/min to ~2/min
- Optimized minute-based logging to only check once per minute instead of every second
- Idle CPU usage should now drop below 1% when waiting for next run

## 🔧 Technical Changes

- `src/cineripr/cli.py`:
  - Settings check interval increased from 5s to 30s (line 734)
  - Added `last_minute_logged` tracking to prevent repeated logging checks (line 723, 769-773)
  - Logging now only triggers once per minute instead of checking every second

## 📦 Deployment

- **Version:** `2.5.17`
- **Docker Image:** `ghcr.io/rokk001/cineripr:2.5.17`
- **Breaking changes:** None
- **Migration:** Not required – restart container with the new tag

## ✅ Verification Checklist
