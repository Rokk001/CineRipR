# Release Notes v2.3.1

**Release Date:** 2025-11-10  
**Type:** Bug Fix

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### System Health Updates Fixed

**Problem:** System information (disk space, CPU usage, memory usage) was not displayed in the WebGUI, showing empty values or "0%".

**Root Cause:** System health metrics were only updated once at application startup, not during runtime.

**Solution:** 
- System health metrics are now updated every 30 seconds during idle periods
- Updates occur continuously in the sleep loop between runs
- All metrics (disk space for Downloads/Extracted/Finished, CPU, memory, 7-Zip version) are refreshed regularly

**Impact:** Users can now see real-time system information in the WebGUI, including:
- Disk space usage for all three directories (Downloads, Extracted, Finished)
- CPU and memory usage percentages
- 7-Zip version information

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Added periodic `update_system_health()` calls in the main sleep loop
- Updates occur every 30 seconds when the application is idle
- No performance impact as updates are lightweight and non-blocking

## 📦 Migration

No migration required. This is a bug fix that works with existing configurations.

## 🚀 Upgrade Instructions

1. Pull the latest Docker image: `docker pull ghcr.io/rokk001/cineripr:latest`
2. Restart your container
3. System information should now be visible in the WebGUI
