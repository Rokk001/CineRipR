## üìù Notes

This release primarily addresses Docker deployment issues and adds support for a new archive format. The changes are backward compatible and should not affect existing installations.

The Docker permission fixes are particularly important for users running CineRipR in containerized environments, as they resolve the common issue of extracted files being read-only for normal users.
