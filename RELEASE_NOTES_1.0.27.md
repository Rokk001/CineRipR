# Release Notes - CineRipR 1.0.27

## Fixed
- Extraction category prefix restored:
  - TV shows → `_extracted/TV-Show/<Series>/Season XX/...`
  - Movies → `_extracted/Movies/<ReleaseName>/...`
- No changes to finished archiving logic

## Notes
- `extracted` remains the final destination for extracted content
- `finished` mirrors downloads 1:1 per release root.
