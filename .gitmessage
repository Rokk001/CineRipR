# Commit Message Guidelines
# 
# NEVER include:
# - Specific file paths from user's local environment
# - UNC paths like \\HS\Download\...
# - Local directory structures
# - Personal/private information
# - ANY real paths from user's system
# 
# ALWAYS use:
# - Generic descriptions
# - Placeholder examples
# - General technical terms
# 
# Example: "Fixed Windows UNC path handling" NOT "Fixed \\HS\Download\dcpp\A.Test.Extract"
# 
# CRITICAL: Before ANY commit or release, scan for:
# - Backslashes followed by letters (UNC paths)
# - Specific folder names from user's system
# - Any path that looks like a real directory
# 
# If found, replace with generic placeholders like:
# - \\SERVER\Share\... -> \\SERVER\Share\...
# - Specific folder names -> Generic folder names
# - Real file names -> Example file names
